UnityNetworkPacketTracer

# Description
The program emulates a network environment, mainly focusing on the application and transport layers.
The library contains DataLink and NetworkEntity classes which are helpful for connecting and creating network simulations.
The project can be expanded and used to craete more complex networks.

This project started as a makeup question in my networking course at [KFUPM](http://www.kfupm.edu.sa/Default.aspx).
The example under [releases](https://github.com/buzamahmooza/UnityNetworkPacketTracer/releases), the program is emulating an environment where a host is sending an email through a web server, and initiating DNS lookups.
The main purpose is to show the process of communication between nodes and the approximating delays between the messages.

# How to use:
For the example case in the [releases](https://github.com/buzamahmooza/UnityNetworkPacketTracer/releases), the link speeds/propagation delays can be set by clicking the links and entering a new value. the format used is propogationDelay/linkSpeed


# Team members:
